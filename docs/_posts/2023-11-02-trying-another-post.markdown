This is another blog post that I'm using to test out some Jekyll functionality. Right now I'm trying to set up the [Blog Posts] page with Bootstrap so that it looks prettier, but I need at least two blog posts to actually test that out.

The highlighting features that Jekyll provides are pretty great! I hop it has options for all of the languages I like.

{% highlight python %}
def print_hi(name)
    print("Hello, World!")
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hello, World!' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
